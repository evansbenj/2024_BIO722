## A quick note about genetic samples

Your statistical power, precision, and accuracy will depend on the quantity and quality of your data.  These factors, of course, depend on the starting material you use for sequencing.  Excitingly, a bunch of recent studies suggest that RRGS can be used on sub-optimal samples, for example from museum specimens, fecal extractions, and the like.  Nonetheless, it is in your interest to use as high quality DNA as possible.  
- For animal tissue, I recommend using ethanol or RNAlater to preserve your tissues and I suggest chilling your samples (at -20 or -80 degrees) as soon as possible after collection.
- For DNA extraction, I've had success using Qiagen DNEasy extraction kits.  These kits can be used in any lab that has a heat block and a centrifuge.  When a small amount of starting material is being used I recommend reducing the volume of elution buffer you use in order to concentrate the DNA.  You can always dilute it later, and it is harder and less efficient to make a sample more concentrated.
- If you want to outsource the library preparation (I always have), I recommend using an agarose gel to normalize the concentration of your samples and ensure that the quality is as good as possible.  Different methods have different requirements in terms of the volume and concentration of gDNA, but most expect these parameters to be uniform across the samples you submit.
- If you have many samples, I suggest extracting and comparing more than you plan to run so you can choose the best ones. 

## How much does this cost and where can I do it?

I've done RADseq multiple times at [Floragenix](http://www.floragenex.com/), which is located in Oregon, USA.  I've also done Genotype by Sequencing at [Cornell University](http://www.biotech.cornell.edu/brc/genomic-diversity-facility) in New York, USA.  In 2015, the prices for a 95 RADseq sample run, including library preparation and one lane of single end Illumina sequencing but no bioinformatics was  US$7725.  In 2015, the price of a 95 GBS run with two single end lanes of Illumina sequencing was $6,080 (considerably less expensive). I think RADseq services are also available at the University of Edinburgh.  I anticipate that the cost of these services will decline considerably over the next few years and that more sequencing centers will offer this service.

## A quick note about Markdown and Github

This website is written in a markup language called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and hosted by [Github](www.github.com).  I've found both of these tools to be easy to learn and very useful.

# Introduction to Quality Control, De-multiplexing, and Trimming of Illumina Data

## Fasta and Fastq format

Illumina sequence data is provided in a text file that is in a format called `fastq`.  This is a modification of another format called `fasta` in which each sequence has a header that begins with a `>` sign.  This is followed by the sequences.  Here is an example:

```
>example_sequence_in_fasta_format`
ATGCGCGCGCTAGGCTCGCGATCGGGGAGCGCGAGCTGAGCTAGCGCGATGCGCCCCGAC
```

The format of `fastq` files is similar to `fasta` except that quality scores are included.  Each sequence has four lines (instead of two for `fasta` files).  The first begins with `@` followed by information about the sequence.  The second line is the nucleotide sequence. The third line is a `+` which may be followed by the same information that followed the `@` sign in the first line.  The fourth line is the quality values.  For the Illumina data we will be working with, these values range from 0â€“41 and are represented by single characters.  More details about fastq format is available [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format).  Here is an example of a sequence in fastq format:

```
@HWI-ST724:202:D127MACXX:6:2114:13665:74490
TGCAGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGAAATTTTTGGGCACAAAGAACCACAGAAAAAAAATGAAAA
+HWI-ST724:202:D127MACXX:6:2114:13665:74490
AFHJJJFIJJJJIJJJJJHFDDDDDB0530&0)00&)0&05007BDD############################################
```

In this sequence the number signs indicate low quality reads at the end (right side) of the sequence.  

## Example data
The data we will be working witb are single end 100 bp reads from one Illumina lane. The data are from 9 individuals that were barcoded and multiplexed on this lane (see below for more explanation). The path to the data is:

`/1/scratch/monkey_data/forward.fastq`

## Quality Control
Before we do anything with individual sequences, it is a good idea to survey the overall quality of the data.  We can do this with many free tools; for this class we will use a program called [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).  To run this program please type this:
`/usr/local/fastqc/fastqc -o output_directory datafile`
where `output_directory` is the directory to which you want to write the output and `datafile` is the example dataset listed above (or whereever your data are). This should give you some feedback about the analysis as it runs and generate a file called `datafile.zip` in the output directory.  

Here is an example of a commandline I ran:
`/usr/local/fastqc/fastqc -o /home/evanslab/ forward_subset.fastq`

(You would have to change the `evanslab` part to match your home directory because you don't have write permissions to my directory).

Please download this to your computer, uncompress it, and open the `.html` file in a browser.  Ben will go over some of the quality control plots that were generated.

## De-Multiplexing
Most RRGS methods rely on the Illumina sequencing platform.  These machines generate data using something called a "flowcell" that is divided up into eight "lanes".  Small scale projects typically would run multiple samples (from different species or different individuals within a species) on one lane.  Because the sequence methodology requires the ligation (attachment) of a linker (a bit of DNA) to each side of bits of DNA that will be sequenced, it is straightforward to combine multiple samples (multiplex) from different individuals in a single lane. This is done by adding a unique identifier sequence (a barcode) to the linker that is used on each sample.  Note that this barcode is different from "DNA barcoding", the latter of which generally refers to the use of a small variable genomic region (such as the COI gene for animals) for species and population identification.

A first step in our analysis pipeline is to organize data from each of our samples that were run together on an Illumina lane (De-multiplexing our data) and also to filter our data and trim off bits that have lots of errors or that have sequences from the laboratory procedures that were used to generate the data (Trimming/Quality control).  To begin please make sure you are in your home directory by typing this:

`cd ~`

When samples are run on an Illumina machine, DNA is broken up into many small fragments and a small bit of DNA called an adaptor is then added on each of the fragments. This adaptor allows the sequencing process to occur, essentially by making possible high-throughput put polymerase chain reaction (ask Ben about this if you are unfamiliar). To make possible the multiplexing of samples on one Illumina lane, each sample is linked to a unique adaptor that contains a "barcode" sequence that allows us to sort out which samples each sequence came from.  For our dataset, we have nine individuals from one species (the Tonkean macaque). Each of the samples received the following barcodes (the barcode and sample name are separated by a tab):
```
CCTCTTATCA	PF515
TATCGTTAGT	PM561
TAGTGCGGTC	PM565
GGCCGGTAAC	PM566
AGGAACCTCG	PM567
TTATCCGTAG	PM582
CGCTATACGG	PM584
CACGCAACGA	PM592
ATCCGTCTAC	PM602
```
We will use this information in a moment to de-multiplex our data.  Lets use emacs to make a text file that contains this information.  Please use your favourite text editor to generate a file with this information called `monkey.barcodes`.


## Quality control and trimming

A first step in analysis of Illumina data is to identify adaptor and barcode sequences in our data, sort sequneces by the barcode, and remove the adaptor and barcode sequences from the data.  We can also get rid of sequences that have ambiguous barcodes due to sequencing errors. We additionally can get rid of sequences with low quality scores and trim them all so they have the same length (this last step would not normally be done for RNAseq data but it is a reasonable thing to do for RADseq data).

Illumina generates sequences that have errors in base calls.  Errors typically become more common towards the end of the sequence read, and sometimes (but not always) an "N" is inserted in positions where the base pair is difficult to call.  But sometimes it makes an incorrect call as well. 

We will use software package called `Stacks` to de-multiplex and trim our data.  This is actually a suite of programs and we will be using the application called `process_radtags` within `Stacks`.  `Stacks` has a very nice online manual [here](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/manual/#clean). FYI, other software that does trimmong of RADseq data is available [here](https://github.com/johnomics/RADtools/blob/master/RADpools).

Brian has installed most of the software we need in a directory called `/usr/local/bin`.  The command to execute this program on our data is:

`/usr/local/bin/process_radtags -f <inputfile> -b <barcode_file> -o ./samples/ -e sbfI -t 75 -r -c -q --adapter_1 GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG --adapter_2 AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT --adapter_mm 2 --filter_illumina`

As detailed in the online manual, the first part (`/usr/local/bin/process_radtags`) directs the computer to run the program process_radtags, which is in the director called `/usr/local/bin/`.  The `-f` flag specifies where the data are and <inputfile> provides the path and filename of the data.  The `-b` flag specifies where the barcode file is that we made eariler and <barcode_file> provides the path and name for this file.  The `-o` flag tells `process_radtags` to put the demultiplexed data in a folder called `./samples`, which we should make in advance using the unix `mkdir` command.  The `-e` flag tells `process_radtags` that the restriction enzyme called sbfI was used to generate the data. The `-t` flag tells `process_radtags` to trim all sequences to be 75 base pairs long. The `-r`, `-c`, and `-q` flags directs `process_radtags` to respectively
- rescue barcodes and RADtags when possible allowing upto a default value of 2 mismatches (this number can be changed too if you want)
- clean the data and remove reads with any uncalled bases, and 
- discard reads with low quality scores.  

THe other flags tell `process_radtags` to remove adapter sequences that are specified and to remove bad reads recognized by the Illumina sequencing software.  Other details, such as the type of quality scores are set at default values. All of this information is available, of course, in the manual that comes with the program. 

## Practice problem 1: How many reads do we have for each individual?

As an exercise, please use the [`grep`](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?grep) command to count how many reads we have for each individual.  A hint is that using `grep`, you can count the number of times an identifier character for each sequence appears in each file for each individual.  Another hint is that you can get the manual for any `Unix` command by typing `man command`.  Which individual has the most reads?  Which has the least reads?  Can you think of a reason that some samples have lots of reads while others have less?

How would your `grep` command differ for a `fasta` file compared to a `fastq` file?

## Practice problem 2: How did trimming affect the quality assay?

Please use FastQC to evaluate read quality of your trimmed sequences.  How do the trimmed reads differ from the untrimmed reads?

## OK, now we are ready to move on to mapping reads to a reference genome.  Please click [here](https://github.com/evansbenj/BIO720/blob/master/2_Lecture_2_reference_genomes_and_read_mapping.md).
